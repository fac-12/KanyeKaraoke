# KANYE KARAOKE READ ME
http://kanyekaraoke.surge.sh/
## Objective:

The project this week was to build a simple web app (ideally just a single page). We had to query at least two APIs and use the results to update our DOM.

- [x] Your app queries at least two APIs using the XMLHttpRequest method
- [x] Your app features some dynamic content
- [x] A clearly defined user journey, documented in your readme.
- [ ] A well-considered architecture for your app - think back to the workshops from the beginning of this week. Try to modularise your code, or break it down into separate files. Document any key decisions about how you structure your code in your readme!
- [x] Code: break your JavaScript down into small functions with a clear input and output; this will make it easy to write tests
- [x] Tests: you must write tests!
- [ ] Design: aim for a responsive, mobile-first design
- [ ] Accessibility: same as always, we'll be running your code through accessibility checkers
- [x] Take appropriate measures when it comes to concealing private information (i.e. your API key!)

### The APIs we worked with:
1. [YouTube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/)
2.  [Kanye Rest](http://www.kanyerest.xyz/) - a student hack project.

### Considering the user journey:
Enabling a user to search, aquire and play any Kanye West video with the lyrics alongside it so they can sing along. If it exists, play the video and if it doesn't exist, you receive an error message.

### Building our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and splitting up the tasks
We went through the whole build of the site and split the tasks between pairs. Programming pairs were swapped daily and we rotated to ensure that everyone had a go at each task.
