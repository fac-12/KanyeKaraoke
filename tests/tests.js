Have you seen her? My psychic told me she'll have an ass like Serena Trina, Jeena-fah Lopez, four kids And I gotta take all they bad ass to ShowBiz Okay, get your kids, but then they got their friends I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in We all went to din and then I had to pay If you fuckin' with this girl then you better be paid You know why? It take too much to touch her From what I heard she got a baby by Busta My best friend said she used to fuck with Usher I don't care what none of y'all say, I still love her Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger, uh But she ain't messin' wit' no broke niggas, uh Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger, uh But she ain't messin' wit' no broke niggas, uh Get down girl, go 'head get down Get down girl, go 'head get down Get down girl, go 'head get down Get down girl, go 'head Eighteen years, eighteen years She got one of yo' kids, got you for eighteen years I know somebody payin' child support for one of his kids His baby mama car and crib is bigger than his You will see him on TV, any given Sunday Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money She went to the doctor got lipo with your money She walkin' around lookin' like Michael with your money Should've got that insured, GEICO for your money If you ain't no punk Holla we want prenup (We want prenup!) Yeah, it's something that you need to have 'Cause when she leave your ass she gon' leave with half Eighteen years, eighteen years And on her eighteenth birthday, he found out it wasn't his Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger, uh But she ain't messin' wit' no broke niggas, uh Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger, uh But she ain't messin' wit' no broke niggas, uh Get down girl, go 'head get down, uh Get down girl, go 'head get down Get down girl, go 'head get down, uh Get down girl, go 'head Now I ain't sayin' you a gold digger, you got needs You don't want a dude to smoke but he can't buy weed You got out to eat and he can't pay, y'all can't leave There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves But while y'all washin', watch him He gon' make it into a Benz out of that Datsun He got that ambition, baby, look at his eyes This week he moppin' floors, next week it's the fries So, stick by his side I know there's dude's ballin', but yeah that's nice And they gon' keep callin' and tryin', but you stay right, girl And when you get on, he leave yo' ass for a white girl Get down girl, go 'head get down Get down girl, go 'head get down Get down girl, go 'head get down Get down girl, go 'head",
